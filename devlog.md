to put these characters into foundry I need to not use body as a tag, and link the style sheet outside of the header. if possible. 
might also have refactor some of the rules to not conflict with existing classes

we may want to make the non-print version a little more compact, this character sheet is awkward in foundry
also, the foundry version ought to have checkboxes for stress and other little helpful tweaks.
