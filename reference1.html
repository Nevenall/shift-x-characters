      <h2>Terms</h2>
      <p><strong>Assets</strong> are durable details introduced into the narrative. They have their own ratings and last for the rest of the scene.</p>
      <p><strong>Advantages</strong> are temporary &plus;2 bonuses with a flavor <strong>tag</strong>. They last until after your next action. They can be passed to allies.</p>
      <p>A <strong>call on</strong> is allowed for some traits, such as distinctions. When your trait applies to the narrative circumstances you may spend a determination and call on that trait to make a second roll and keep the better result. Alternatively, if you've succeeded on a roll, you may gain a determination if you roll again and keep the worst result.</p>
      <p>To <strong>concede</strong> from a conflict, spend a determination and describe how you are removed from the scene.</p>
      <p>A <strong>consequence</strong> is a negative distinction that represents a wound you have taken.</p>
      <p>Characters can be <strong>compelled</strong> based on their traits, especially distinctions and limits, or the narrative circumstances. Compels can be mechanical, such as shutting down a power; or they can suggest that the character make a bad choice, or suffer bad luck. If you accept a compel you suffer the narrative suggestion and gain a determination, if your refuse the compel you must spend a determination to avoid misfortune.</p>
      <p><strong>Determination</strong> is our name for Fate Points. It's a metacurrency used mostly for bonuses to rolls and gained with narrative misfortune.</p>
      <p><strong>Distinctions</strong> are phrases that describe fundamental things about a character. Distinctions can be called on and bring characters vexing misfortune.</p>
      <p>A <strong>major cost</strong> means the narrative situation gets significantly worse or more complicated. Major costs include introducing new problems, bringing in new foes, putting the players on an imminent deadline, inflicting a mild or moderate consequence, and giving the enemy a new advantage or asset.</p>
      <p>A <strong>minor cost</strong> is a story detail about difficulty or complication but isn't a hindrances itself: a few points of stress, an advantage, or doom to the enemy.</p>
      <p><strong>Opposition</strong> is the rating that opposes your actions. Based on what you are attempting, the narrative circumstances, and villains who oppose you.</p>
      <p><strong>SWS</strong> stands for Success with Style. It's like a critical hit and indicated that you've achieved something beyond your intent.</p>
      <p><strong>Support</strong> Extra help from other heroes or related powers.</p>
      <p><strong>Taken out</strong> occurs when you take damage you cannot absorb. You are removed from the scene in a manner of your foe's choosing.</p>

      <p><strong>Trait</strong> is a generic word for a mechanical element a character might possess.</p>
      <p><strong>Vexing Misfortune</strong> occurs when something unavoidable and terrible occurs to the heroes. In return they get determination.</p>
